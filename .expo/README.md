# Ambulance Camera App

This React Native (Expo) app allows you to:
1. Take multiple photos of an ambulance (using the mobile camera).
2. Automatically analyze each photo via Roboflowâ€™s API.
3. Display an "Image Analysis" section beneath each photo, showing which items were detected and their confidence values.
4. Tap Result to get an overall equipment summary in a modal (e.g., Oxygen Cylinder, Stretcher, Suction, etc.)
